# Binilla

## What is this repository for?

* Current Version: 0.9.1

* Binilla is a universal, GUI based, binary structure editor powered by [supyr_struct](https://bitbucket.org/Moses_of_Egypt/supyr_struct). Binilla is capable of generating editing interfaces for any binary structures defined with the supyr_struct library. Meta data can be embedded into the supyr_struct descriptors to customize the way Binilla displays the structures. This includes specifying custom widgets, field value ranges, visibility of fields, whether a field can be edited, comments, tooltips, field units, and more.

* Below are a few versions of Binilla displaying various structures. Even the configuration window is generated from a supyr_struct structure definition.
